      <p><em>Senior UX/UI Designer at <strong>Digital Inks</strong></em></p>
      <p>I am a senior UX UI designer at Digital Inks. My work revolves around solving customer problems and trying to help anyone who needs it within company. Although now a UX/UI Designer, I used to work as a Software test engineer previously. But I always felt there was something missing. I tried my hands on Designing and found that it fits perfectly in my requirement. But being a software test engineer also helped me to prepare test cases and user scenarios while solving customers problems and it has come in handy a lot of times. On a personal level i am sort of spiritually inclined person and big follower of sadhguru jaggi vasudev and Gaur Gopal Das. So thats all about me. </p></td>
